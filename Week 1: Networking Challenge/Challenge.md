### 1️⃣ **Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models**  
📖 Learn the **OSI and TCP/IP models**, their **layers, functions, and real-world applications**.  
✅ **Task:** Write real-world examples of how each layer is used (e.g., **HTTP at the Application Layer, TCP at the Transport Layer**).  

### 2️⃣ **Protocols and Ports for DevOps**  
🔍 Study **commonly used networking protocols** (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS) and their **port numbers**.  
✅ **Task:** Create a **blog, article, GitHub page, or README** listing these protocols with their relevance in **DevOps workflows**.  

### 3️⃣ **AWS EC2 and Security Groups**  
☁️ Launch an **AWS EC2 instance (free tier is fine)** and explore **Security Groups**.  
🔐 Understand how Security Groups help **control inbound and outbound traffic**.  
✅ **Task:** Write a **step-by-step guide or blog** on how to **create and configure Security Groups**.  

### 4️⃣ **Hands-On with Networking Commands**  
🔧 Practice essential **networking commands**:  
- `ping` → Check connectivity  
- `traceroute` / `tracert` → Trace packet routes  
- `netstat` → View network statistics  
- `curl` → Make HTTP requests  
- `dig` / `nslookup` → Perform DNS lookups  

✅ **Task:** Create a **cheat sheet or short guide** explaining the **purpose and usage** of each command.

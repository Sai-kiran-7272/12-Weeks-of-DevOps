# **Deep Dive into Linux File & Directory Permissions**  

Managing **file and directory permissions** is a crucial part of Linux system administration. Proper permissions ensure that **only authorized users** can access or modify files, which is essential for system security.  

In this guide, we’ll break down:  
✅ **How to create a directory and a file**  
✅ **How to set file permissions using chmod**  
✅ **How to verify permissions using ls -l**  

Let’s dive in! 🚀

## **📌 Understanding Linux File & Directory Permissions**  

Every file and directory in Linux has **three types of access permissions**:  
1. **Read (r)** → Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing files in a directory.  
2. **Write (w)** → Allows modifying a file or adding/deleting files in a directory.  
3. **Execute (x)** → Allows running a file as a program or entering a directory.  

### **👥 Who Can Access Files? (User, Group, Others)**  
Linux assigns **permissions** to three categories of users:  
- **Owner (u)** → The user who created the file or directory.  
- **Group (g)** → A group of users with shared access.  
- **Others (o)** → Everyone else who is not the owner or part of the group.

## **🔹 Step 1: Creating a Directory and a File**  

### **Command:**  
```bash
mkdir /devops_workspace
touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
```  

### **Breaking it Down:**  
1️⃣ `mkdir /devops_workspace`  
- `mkdir` → Creates a new **directory**.  
- `/devops_workspace` → The **name of the directory** being created.  

📌 **Why use `/devops_workspace` instead of just `devops_workspace`?**  
- Using `/` places the directory at the **root level**, making it accessible system-wide.  
- If you don’t use `/`, it will create the directory inside your current location.  

2️⃣ `touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt`  
- `touch` → Creates a **new empty file**.  
- `/devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` → Specifies the **file name and location** inside the directory.  

📌 **Why use `touch`?**  
- It creates a new **empty** file without opening an editor.  
- If the file already exists, it simply **updates** its timestamp without modifying its contents.

## **🔹 Step 2: Setting Permissions**  

### **Command:**  
```bash
chmod 640 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
```  

### **Breaking it Down:**  
- `chmod` → Stands for **Change Mode** and is used to modify file permissions.  
- `640` → The **permission code** specifying who can access the file.  
- `/devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` → The **file to modify**.  

### **🔍 What Does `640` Mean?**  

🔢 **Breaking Down the Number (640) in Binary:**  
Each digit represents **permissions** in the order: **Owner | Group | Others**  

| User Type | Binary | Decimal | Permission |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Owner (u)** | 110 | `6` | Read + Write (`rw-`) |
| **Group (g)** | 100 | `4` | Read-only (`r--`) |
| **Others (o)** | 000 | `0` | No Access (`---`) |

📌 **Final Permission Set:**  
✅ **Owner can read & write** (rw-)  
✅ **Group can only read** (r--)  
❌ **Others have no access** (---)  

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Verifying Permissions**  

### **Command:**  
```bash
ls -l /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
```  

### **Breaking it Down:**  
- `ls -l` → Lists files in **long format**, displaying detailed permissions.  
- `/devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` → The **file whose permissions** we are checking.  

### **Example Output:**  
```bash
-rw-r----- 1 user devops_team 0 Feb 10 12:00 project_notes.txt
```  

### **Understanding the Output:**  
- `-rw-r-----` → **File permissions**  
- `1` → Number of **hard links**  
- `user` → **Owner** of the file  
- `devops_team` → **Group** assigned to the file  
- `0` → File **size (in bytes)**  
- `Feb 10 12:00` → **Last modified date**  
- `project_notes.txt` → **File name**  

📌 **Breaking Down the Permission String (`-rw-r-----`)**  
| Position | Meaning | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `-` | File type (`-` = file, `d` = directory) | `-` |
| `rw-` | **Owner permissions** (read + write) | ✅ |
| `r--` | **Group permissions** (read-only) | ✅ |
| `---` | **Others (no access)** | ❌ |

## **📌 Summary of Commands and Their Purpose**  

| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| `mkdir /devops_workspace` | Creates a new directory named `devops_workspace`. |
| `touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` | Creates an empty file named `project_notes.txt`. |
| `chmod 640 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` | Sets file permissions: Owner can read/write, Group can read, Others have no access. |
| `ls -l /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt` | Displays file permissions and details. |

## **📌 Final Thoughts**  

Understanding **file permissions** is essential for **security** and **access control** in Linux. By using `chmod`, you can ensure that **only the right users** have the necessary permissions.  

🚀 **Next Steps:**  
- Try different permission codes (`750`, `600`, `777`) and observe the changes using `ls -l`.  
- Experiment with `chmod u+x filename` to make a file executable.  
- Learn about **chown** (`sudo chown user:group filename`) to change ownership.

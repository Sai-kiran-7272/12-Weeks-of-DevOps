# **📌 Automating Backups with Shell Scripting & Cron Jobs**  

**Automation** is essential in DevOps, and **backing up data** is one of the most critical tasks to prevent data loss. In this lesson, you'll learn how to **create a shell script** for backups and schedule it using **cron jobs** to run automatically.  

---

## **🔹 Why Automate Backups?**  
✅ Prevents data loss in case of system failure.  
✅ Saves time by running automatically.  
✅ Ensures consistency in backups without manual intervention.  

---

## **🛠 Task Breakdown & Explanation**  

### **1️⃣ Write a Backup Script**  
We will create a shell script that compresses the `/devops_workspace` directory into a **timestamped backup file**.  

#### **🔹 Backup Script (`backup.sh`)**  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf /backups/backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /devops_workspace
echo -e "\e[32mBackup successful!\e[0m"
```

#### **🔹 Breakdown of the Script**  

1️⃣ `#!/bin/bash` → **Shebang**  
   - Tells the system to run this script using the Bash shell.  
   - Every shell script **must start** with this line.  

2️⃣ `tar -czf /backups/backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /devops_workspace`  
   - **`tar`** → Archive utility that creates compressed backups.  
   - **`-c`** → Create a new archive.  
   - **`-z`** → Compress using `gzip`.  
   - **`-f /backups/backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz`**  
     - `-f` → Specifies the **filename** of the archive.  
     - `backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz` →  
       - `$(date +%F)` → Generates a timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for easy tracking.  
       - Example: `backup_2025-02-10.tar.gz`.  
   - **`/devops_workspace`** → The directory to be backed up.  

3️⃣ `echo -e "\e[32mBackup successful!\e[0m"`  
   - `echo` → Prints a message.  
   - `-e` → Enables interpretation of special characters.  
   - `\e[32m` → Changes text color to **green** for success messages.  
   - `\e[0m` → Resets text color to default.  

---

### **2️⃣ Make the Script Executable**  
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```
#### **🔹 Breakdown of `chmod +x`**  
- `chmod` → **Changes file permissions**.  
- `+x` → **Adds execute permission**, allowing the script to be run as a program.  

After this step, you can execute the script with:  
```bash
./backup.sh
```

---

### **3️⃣ Schedule Automatic Backups with Cron Jobs**  

#### **🔹 Edit the Cron Job List**  
```bash
crontab -e
```
- Opens the **cron job editor** for scheduling tasks.  

#### **🔹 Add the Following Line to Run the Script Daily at Midnight**  
```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
```

#### **🔹 Understanding Cron Job Syntax (`0 0 * * *`)**  
A cron job uses **five fields** to specify the schedule:  

| Field | Allowed Values | Meaning |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Minute | `0-59` | At which minute the job runs. |
| Hour | `0-23` | At which hour the job runs. |
| Day of Month | `1-31` | On which day of the month to run. |
| Month | `1-12` | In which month to run. |
| Day of Week | `0-7` (0 & 7 = Sunday) | On which day of the week to run. |

#### **🔹 Example Breakdown (`0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh`)**  
- `0` → Run at **minute 0** (start of the hour).  
- `0` → Run at **hour 0** (midnight).  
- `* * *` → Run **every day, every month, every year**.  

💡 **This ensures the backup script runs automatically every midnight** without manual execution.

## **🔍 Understanding Command Options (`-f, -d, -t` etc.)**  

| **Option** | **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| `-c` | `tar -czf` | Creates a new archive. |
| `-z` | `tar -czf` | Compresses the archive with gzip. |
| `-f` | `tar -czf filename.tar.gz` | Specifies the filename. |
| `-e` | `echo -e "text"` | Enables special character interpretation. |
| `-x` | `chmod +x` | Makes a file executable. |
| `+%F` | `date +%F` | Formats the date as `YYYY-MM-DD`. |

---

## **✅ Key Takeaways**  
🔹 **Automation** saves time and prevents human error.  
🔹 `tar` is a **powerful tool** for creating and compressing backups.  
🔹 `chmod +x` makes the script **runnable**.  
🔹 `cron jobs` allow **automatic scheduling** of scripts.  

By automating backups, you ensure your data is always **safe and up-to-date** without manual effort! 🚀
